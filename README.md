# GearUp

GearUp is a mobile-first equipment tracking prototype for small-scale military logistics (up to a few hundred items).  
It helps field teams manage sign-outs and accountability quickly — directly from the phone.

## Who is it for?
- Military teams handling **small logistics** (platoon/company level)
- Field users who need a **fast, mobile-friendly** way to sign and track items

## The problem
In the field, the “office computer” is usually not available.  
Tracking equipment via Excel/Sheets on a phone is uncomfortable and slow, so sign-outs often don’t happen in real time.

As a result, by the end of an operational period, equipment frequently goes missing — mainly because it’s inconvenient to properly sign and document items while in the field.

## The solution
GearUp provides a shared platform where:
- Logistics personnel can **add equipment** and **sign items in/out**
- Team members can **see what they are signed for**
- Access is controlled by **role/rank**, so each user has permissions based on responsibility

## Current status
✅ Prototype (MVP concept)  
- The prototype is built around **tables** (inventory + assignments)  
- Each user has an account, and permissions vary by role/rank  
- Focus: clear tracking, simple sign flow, quick mobile usage

## Core features (prototype)
- Equipment inventory table (up to hundreds of items)
- Sign-out / assignment tracking per user
- Multi-user shared view (department/platoon/company level)
- Role-based permissions (by rank / responsibility)

## Roadmap (next steps)
- Item history log (who had it, when, changes)
- Notifications/reminders for overdue returns
- Search & filters (type, status, owner)
- Export reports (CSV/Excel)
- Authentication + cloud database

## My contribution
- Product thinking & requirements definition
- UX flow and user roles/permissions logic
- Data model design (tables and relationships)
- Prototype creation and iteration
